The content on this repository are my personal solving challenges and mini exercises for the [Swift Apprentice](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/swift-apprentice/v6.0) book from [RayWenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com).

The content of these challenges such as the RW logo belong to this team as it is described on the LICENSE.

> The usage of RW logo is just to make this README to look good on its header.

Although you'll be able to find the solved challenges on the RayWenderlich official GitHub space, the idea of this repo is to keep a track of my own progress through this book.
