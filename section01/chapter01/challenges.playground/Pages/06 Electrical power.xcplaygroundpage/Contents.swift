 # Challenge 6: Electrical power

 The power of an electrical appliance is calculated by multiplying the voltage by the current. Declare a constant named `voltage` of type `Double` and assign it a value. Then declare a constant called `current` of type `Double` and assign it a value. Finally calculate the power of the electrical appliance youâ€™ve just created storing it in a constant called `power` of type `Double`.

let voltage: Double = 120
let current: Double = 5.0

let power = voltage * current
