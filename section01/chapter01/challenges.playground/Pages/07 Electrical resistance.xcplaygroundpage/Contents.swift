 # Challenge 7: Electrical resistance

 The resistance of such an appliance can then be calculated (in a long-winded way) as the power divided by the current squared. Calculate the resistance and store it in a constant called `resistance` of type `Double`.

let current: Double = 5.0
let power: Double = 600

let resistance = power / (current * current)
