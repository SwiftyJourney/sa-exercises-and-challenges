 * Create a constant named `range`, and set it equal to a range starting at 1 and ending with 10 inclusive. Write a `for` loop that iterates over this range and prints the square of each number.
 */

let range = 1...10

for i in range {
  print("\(i * 2)")

//: * Write a `for` loop to iterate over the same range as in the exercise above and print the square root of each number. Youâ€™ll need to type convert your loop constant.

print("\n===\n")
for i in range {
  print(Double(i).squareRoot())
}

/*:
 * Above, you saw a `for` loop that iterated over only the even rows like so:

 ```
 sum = 0
 for row in 0..<8 {
   if row % 2 == 0 {
     continue
   }
   for column in 0..<8 {
     sum += row * column
   }
 }
 ```

 Change this to use a where clause on the first for loop to skip even rows instead of using continue. Check that the sum is 448, as in the initial example
 */

var sum = 0
for row in 0..<8 where row % 2 == 1 {
  for column in 0..<8 {
    sum += row * column
  }
}
sum

sum = 0
for row in 0..<8 {
  if row % 2 == 0 {
    continue
  }
  for column in 0..<8 {
    sum += row * column
  }
}
